In California, it is legal to purchase and sale Marijuana for Medical purposes. We sale Medical Marijuana with the restriction that they are not used by third parties against the law, Commerce does not propose to induce anyone to act against the law. With this we explicitly point out that anyone who buys our Medical Marijuana is responsible for their future actions. If it is used for human consumption it will always be under the sole responsibility of the buyer and on this fact High5 Delivery Service declines all possible liability. We strongly advise you to ask for information about the regulations that apply and comply with the law. It is prohibited to purchase these products from countries where marijuana or cannabis is prohibited by law, for example: USA (other than California, USA), Canada, Australia, Germany and Asian countries or any other country where the possession of marijuana or cannabis is illegal. No shipments of marijuana to these countries will be made under any circumstances. However, if a purchaser irresponsibly buys any of these products without having previously been informed of local laws in this regard, High5 Delivery Service declines all responsibility for possible legal problems incurred and will not make refunds for materials paralysed or rejected by customs in the performance of their duty.
